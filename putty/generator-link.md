Then open Putty and adjust with "Change settings" option

When pleased with result, go to "Session" category in "Change settings" and save upon new session name.

Then go to regedit.exe. and export `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\save-test`, we only need "Colour*" entries so you
can leave only these.
